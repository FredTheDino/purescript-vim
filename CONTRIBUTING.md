## Preparing a pull request or patch

[Pull requests](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-vim/pulls) may be opened on the primary Git forge. If you do not have a Microsoft GitHub account or would prefer, there is also a [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~toastal/purescript-vim-devel) that can be used with [`git send-email`](https://git-send-email.io).

Patches/pull request checklist:

- [ ] Opened an [issue](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-aff/issues) or posted to the [discussion mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~toastal/purescript-vim-discuss) before investing a significant amount of work into changes
- [ ] Update README.md with any new configuration options and behavior
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with the proposed changes
- [ ] Run `./generate-doc.sh` to re-generate the documentation (requires [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx))
